# $100 Landing Page - Example Site

This is the actual website for IR Green Innovations, built using the same process I use for $100 landing page clients.

## What You're Looking At

- **Pure HTML/CSS/JS** - No frameworks, no complexity
- **Mobile-responsive** - Works perfectly on phones and tablets with hamburger menu
- **Modular components** - Reusable header and footer
- **Fast loading** - Optimized for speed and simplicity
- **Professional design** - Clean, modern aesthetic
- **SEO-friendly** - Proper meta tags and structure

## The Process

1. **You provide content** - Your copy, images, and key messages
2. **I build it fast** - Using the same approach as this site
3. **One day delivery** - Complete, functional landing page
4. **Free hosting setup** - Deployed to Vercel's free tier
5. **One revision round** - Make it exactly what you need

## What This Cost Me

- **Time**: About 2 hours total (content creation, coding, deployment)
- **Tools**: Claude AI for rapid development + logo design
- **Hosting**: $0 (Vercel free tier)
- **Domain**: ~$12/year (you handle this part)

*Logo was also generated by Claude AI. For validation and early testing, this works great - but as you grow, definitely invest some of that saved budget in a proper designer. We shouldn't let the robots do everything (no offense, Claude).*

## Why This Works

This site does exactly what a good landing page should: clearly explains what I do, builds trust, and gets people to take action. No subscription fees, no ongoing costs, just a professional web presence that works.
