            <h1>About</h1>
            
            <p>I'm Irsyad, and I work on building solutions for climate change, social mobility, and the loneliness epidemic through training that builds capacity and technology that creates genuine human connection.</p>
            
            <p>I hold three identities that reinforce each other: I'm a <strong>builder</strong> who ships products that solve real problems, a <strong>social innovator</strong> who creates systems for others to drive change, and an <strong>educator</strong> who helps people develop skills they can use forever. Each role makes me better at the others—the farmer insights I gain from field testing inform how I teach human-centered design, the negotiation strategies I coach help me navigate complex partnerships, and the systems thinking I develop helps me build more thoughtful products.</p>
            
            <p>Honestly, I'm pursuing this path because I want the space to build products I believe should exist in the world, while staying open to training opportunities in areas I've been passionate about for years. This combination gives me the flexibility to work on meaningful problems without being constrained by someone else's roadmap or priorities.</p>
            
            <h2>The Builder</h2>
            <p><em>I believe in starting with human behavior before building anything. The most elegant technical solution means nothing if people don't understand why they need it or how to use it.</em></p>
            
            <p>My strongest building experience came at <strong>AgriG8</strong> (2022-2024), where I was employee #1. I took an agri-fintech idea from concept to market validation in 2 months, recruited the entire product development team from scratch, and secured mid-6 figure funding for the company. The work meant testing with ~300 farmers across 14 regions in 5 Southeast Asian countries—not from an office, but actually sitting in rice fields in Vietnam, understanding how people make financial decisions when their livelihoods depend on it. I led business development with NGOs and government partners that contributed to a 50% increase in annual revenue.</p>
            
            <p>At <strong>X0PA AI</strong> (2021-2022), I led product development for bias-free recruitment tools and spearheaded the creation of an internship management system. I managed two separate product pods—5 developers and 2 QA testers for the internship platform, 3 developers and 1 QA tester for the flagship product—and led the technical aspects of tender bidding. The system is now deployed at both Republic Polytechnic and Singapore Polytechnic, serving thousands of students and employers.</p>
            
            <p>Currently at <strong>Hatch Technologies</strong>, I've built a web development agency from scratch that employs youth from disadvantaged backgrounds, creating both economic opportunity and developing technical talent. I also developed an AI-powered marketing report generator that cut report creation from 4 hours to 15 minutes—a 93% efficiency gain that earned Google's AI Trailblazers Innovation Award.</p>
            
            <p>On the side, I'm building three products focused on human connection: an audio sharing platform for contextual conversations, a testimonial system for different life contexts, and a friendship intelligence tool. I prototype fast with Streamlit, build full-stack applications with Node.js, React, MongoDB, and AWS, but always test with real users in their actual environment.</p>
            
            <p>You can see what I'm currently building <a href="product-studio.html" style="color: #2d5016; text-decoration: underline;">here</a>.</p>
            
            <h2>The Social Innovator</h2>
            <p><em>I believe in building systems that enable others to create change, not just solving problems directly. The goal is to amplify human capability and coordination.</em></p>
            
            <p>My defining work was co-founding <strong>Young Sustainable Impact Southeast Asia</strong> (2017-2021), where we built an incubation program that taught young entrepreneurs how to turn passionate ideas into sustainable organizations. Rather than just funding environmental projects, we developed curriculum around systems thinking, stakeholder navigation, and impact measurement. Over four years, we incubated 24 startups and raised $250k+ in funding. Six ventures remained operational 3+ years after program completion, collectively serving 5,000+ beneficiaries through climate adaptation solutions.</p>
            
            <p>The program worked because participants weren't just receiving resources—they were learning frameworks they could apply to any challenge. We created a portfolio that included a rural electrification project providing clean energy to 1,000+ households in the Philippines and a vertical farming initiative creating sustainable livelihoods for 50+ urban farmers in Malaysia.</p>
            
            <p>This systems-building approach shaped how I work at <strong>Hatch Technologies</strong>, where the web development agency I created doesn't just deliver client work—it provides digital sector upskilling and job opportunities to disadvantaged youth in Singapore, creating pathways for economic mobility.</p>
            
            <h2>The Educator</h2>
            <p><em>I believe the most powerful interventions happen when you help people develop skills they can use forever, not just solve their immediate problems.</em></p>
            
            <p>Since 2022, I've been a guest lecturer at <strong>NUS Institute for Engineering Leadership</strong> for the Frugal Innovation course, mentoring 50+ graduate students in developing solutions for health, waste, and economic inclusion challenges. My curriculum contributions focus on stakeholder navigation and minimum viable organization creation—the messy human parts of innovation that engineering programs often skip. Student feedback across 11 participants in 2025 averaged 4.36/5 across relevance, compellingness, and clarity.</p>
            
            <p>I was <strong>Master Trainer for Go Digital ASEAN</strong> (2023-2024), supported by Google.org and The Asia Foundation, training digital transformation across Southeast Asia. I also served as lead trainer for <strong>National Youth Council Singapore's Youth Action Challenge</strong> (2022-2023), training 200+ participants on environmental innovation and uplifting vulnerable groups. Feedback across participants averaged 4.1/5.</p>
            
            <p>My international training includes sessions at <strong>University of Santo Tomas</strong> on sustainable development (2018), <strong>Sunway University</strong> (2018), <strong>Ngee Ann Polytechnic</strong> staff training on the future of food and agriculture and the circular economy (2019), and Carbon 101 workshops for a civil engineering firm in Malaysia (2024).</p>
            
            <p>My education work began at <strong>Tembusu College, NUS</strong> where I coached Heart of Negotiation workshops from 2014-2019, working with students on principled negotiation, conflict resolution, and collaborative problem-solving. At <strong>NUS Business School</strong>, I've been a teaching assistant for BMA5406 in the MBA program, supporting advanced business strategy and negotiation coursework.</p>
            
            <p>I've also delivered keynote talks and presentations at:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Singapore International Foundation Climate Hack 2022</li>
                <li>APARDO 2025 on sustaining rare disease advocacy</li>
                <li>SUTD Create4good 2022</li>
                <li>ITE Aviation Sustainability Forum 2024</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>I collaborate with an HR professional and a psychology professor—both fellow Tembusu alumni I met as undergraduates—to design complex roleplaying scenarios for B2B workshops, creating simulations that mirror the messy realities of partnership negotiations, stakeholder alignment, and crisis communication.</p>
            
            <p>You can see the full range of workshops I offer <a href="training.html" style="color: #2d5016; text-decoration: underline;">here</a>.</p>
            
            <h2>How They Connect</h2>
            <p>Every product I build gets tested with real users in their actual environment. Every workshop I design includes tools participants can use immediately in their work. Every system I create is designed to amplify human capability rather than replace it. Technology and education are most powerful when they help people coordinate better to solve problems that matter.</p>
