            <h1>About</h1>
            
            <p>I'm Irsyad, and I work on building solutions for climate change, social mobility, and the loneliness epidemic through training that builds capacity and technology that creates genuine human connection.</p>
            
            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p><strong>Young Sustainable Impact Southeast Asia</strong> - Co-founded a nonprofit that helped young people start environmental companies. Over four years, we incubated 24 startups and raised $250k+ in funding. This work built a diverse network of deeply passionate and technical professionals who continue to help drive sustainable innovation.</p>
            
            <h2>Teaching & Training</h2>
            <p><strong>NUS College of Design and Engineering</strong> - Guest lecturer for innovation methodology courses, mentoring 50+ graduate students in developing solutions for health, waste, and economic inclusion challenges.</p>
            
            <p><strong>National Youth Council Singapore</strong> - Lead trainer for Youth Action Challenge Season 4, training 200+ participants on environmental innovation.</p>
            
            <p><strong>NUS Business School</strong> - Teaching assistant for BMA5406 in the MBA program, supporting advanced business strategy and negotiation coursework.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Tembusu College, NUS</strong> - Coach for Heart of Negotiation workshops (2014-2019), training students in principled negotiation, conflict resolution, and collaborative problem-solving techniques.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Professional Consulting</strong> - Delivered B2B negotiation session in 2022. I collaborate with an HR professional and a psychology PhD—both huge negotiation enthusiasts—who write roleplaying cases together for complex interpersonal scenarios.</p>
            
            <h2>Approach</h2>
            <p>I believe in starting with human behavior before building anything. Most failed products and ineffective training programs ignore how people actually think and act.</p>
            
            <p>For products, I prototype fast with AI tools, build lean with proven technologies, and optimize for genuine human connection over engagement metrics.</p>
            
            <p>For training, I focus on practical application over theory. Every workshop includes tools participants can use immediately in their work. My background in interpersonal communication, negotiation strategy, and conflict management helps me facilitate productive group dynamics and stakeholder alignment.</p>
