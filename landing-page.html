            <h1>$100 Landing Page</h1>
            <p class="subtitle">Quick, professional web presence without subscription costs</p>
            
            <p>Perfect for pre-revenue businesses, early-stage validation, or anyone who needs a clean, functional landing page without ongoing platform fees. Get online fast, test your idea, and save money for what actually matters.</p>
            
            <h2>Irsyad, this feels out of place. Why do this?</h2>
            <p>Fair question! I work on climate change and human connection, then suddenly I'm hawking web dev services? Here's the thing: I kept watching smart people burn $50/month on Squarespace for a single page they barely update. That's $600/year for something you could own forever for $100. The math annoyed me enough to do something about it.</p>
            
            <h2>Ok cool, but what do I actually get?</h2>
            <p><strong>One professional landing page</strong> that looks good, loads fast, and works on all devices. Clean design, clear messaging, and basic contact form functionality.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Free hosting forever</strong> - Set up on Vercel's free tier, which means zero ongoing hosting costs for simple landing pages. No monthly fees, no surprise bills.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Fast turnaround</strong> - Delivered within one day with one revision round included. Domain costs not included (you buy and own your domain).</p>
            
            <h2>Wait, you're just using AI to build this, aren't you?</h2>
            <p>Yep! I build your landing page using <strong>Claude AI</strong> to speed up development. You could absolutely do this yourself using ChatGPT, Claude, or any AI assistantâ€”the tools are accessible to everyone now.</p>
            
            <p><strong>So why pay $100?</strong> Because cutting 5 hours of learning curve, troubleshooting, and setup down to a one-day delivery is often worth way more than $100 when you're trying to validate an idea or meet a deadline. Plus, I've done this enough times to know what works.</p>
            
            <h2>But I'm technical, couldn't I just DIY this?</h2>
            <p><strong>Time investment:</strong> 5 hours if you're new to this, less if you're technical, but I'm sure you have other things to do.</p>
            <p><strong>My service:</strong> Same result in a day, and one (and only one) revision round included.</p>
            
            <p>Look, if you enjoy fiddling with DNS settings and figuring out Vercel deployment, go for it! But if you'd rather spend those 5 hours on literally anything else, this might be worth it.</p>
            
            <h2>Alright, who actually needs this?</h2>
            <p><strong>Pre-validation businesses</strong> who need web presence without burning cash on subscriptions</p>
            <p><strong>New consultancies</strong> establishing credibility and professional presence quickly</p>
            <p><strong>Freelancers and solo practitioners</strong> who need a professional landing page without the hassle</p>
            <p><strong>Nonprofit organizations</strong> with limited budgets who need simple, effective web presence</p>
            <p><strong>Anyone who's tired of subscription creep</strong> eating into their budget for a single page they barely touch</p>
            
            <h2>What if I need something fancier later?</h2>
            <p>I work with trusted partners who specialize in comprehensive web development, e-commerce platforms, and ongoing digital strategy. Once you've validated your concept and are ready to scale, I can introduce you to developers who will give you exceptional service and build exactly what you need.</p>
            
            <p><strong>But if you're pre-revenue and need just a single page to establish credibility and test your idea, this might be the smartest $100 you spend.</strong></p>
