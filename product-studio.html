            <h2>How We Work</h2>
            
            <h3>Start with Human Behavior</h3>
            <p>Every project begins with understanding emotional needs. We map when people feel specific needs most acutely and what currently stops them from acting on those needs.</p>
            
            <h3>Prototype Fast with Streamlit</h3>
            <p>Before building full applications, we validate core AI features using Streamlit prototypes. This lets us test prompt chains, user interactions, and core utility quickly and cheaply. Many ideas start as Streamlit toys that prove whether people would actually be upset if they disappeared.</p>
            
            <h3>Build with Modern, Proven Tools</h3>
            <p><strong>Prototyping:</strong> Streamlit for AI feature validation and standalone experiments<br>
            <strong>Frontend:</strong> Next.js with React, Tailwind CSS for design systems<br>
            <strong>Backend:</strong> Node.js with Express, hosted on Render<br>
            <strong>Database:</strong> PostgreSQL on Supabase with real-time features<br>
            <strong>Infrastructure:</strong> Vercel deployment, Clerk authentication, PostHog analytics</p>
            
            <h3>Build for Deep Utility, Not Shallow Engagement</h3>
            <p>We follow Superhuman's approach to product-market fit: the users who need these tools should be genuinely upset if they disappeared. We're not optimizing for time-on-platform or user countsâ€”we're building tools that amplify human-ness and presence for the people who really need them.</p>
            
            <h2>Current Projects</h2>
            
            <h3>Personal Podcast App</h3>
            <p><strong>The insight</strong>: People have meaningful recorded conversations but nowhere to share them contextually. You might want to share a deep discussion about career transitions with some friends, a folklore story with family, or keep a recording private for reflectionâ€”but existing platforms force you to choose between fully public or completely private.</p>
            
            <p><strong>The solution</strong>: Flexible audio sharing with granular privacy controls. Record conversations, create unlisted episodes for specific audiences, and build topic-based channels that friends can discover. Whether you're <a href="https://irsyadramthan.com/all-projectsirsyadramthancom/im-33-for-a-moment" style="color: #2d5016; text-decoration: underline;">recording audio memories of your friends on your own</a> or you <a href="http://folklory.com/" style="color: #2d5016; text-decoration: underline;">purchased an audio memory from the good folks at Folklory</a>, you control exactly who hears what.</p>

            <h3>Personal Testimonial Platform</h3>
            <p><strong>The insight</strong>: People need different types of social proof for different contexts, but existing systems are one-size-fits-all. A roommate application needs different testimonials than a job application or dating profile. Plus, people want control over their testimonialsâ€”both giving and receiving them.</p>
            
            <p><strong>The solution</strong>: Context-specific testimonial requests and flexible display options. Create different testimonial campaigns for job applications, roommate searches, side hustles, or dating profiles. Display testimonials publicly, keep them private for personal affirmation, or share selectively. Testimonial givers can update or delete their contributions while receivers maintain access to feedback.</p>

            <h3>Daily Friendship Reflection Tool</h3>
            <p><strong>The insight</strong>: People want to be better friends but lose track of relationships. Social anxiety around "am I good at friendship?" is widespread.</p>
            
            <p><strong>The solution</strong>: Reflection-first friendship intelligence through daily journaling. Turn natural thoughts about friends into meaningful relationship insights and connection opportunities. See patterns in your friendships, discover ways to connect friends with each other, and become more intentional about relationships that matter.</p>

            <h2>Prototypes & Experiments</h2>
            <p><strong>MSDS Generator</strong> - Streamlit-based Gemini Flash wrapper that creates Material Safety Data Sheets for humans. Testing AI prompt chains for practical utility before building full applications.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Say Nice Things</strong> - Prototype for helping people express gratitude and appreciation. Validates prompt sequences for testimonial and appreciation features before integration into larger products.</p>
            
            <h2>About This Work</h2>
            <p>I'm building these products as an independent founder exploring how technology can genuinely improve human relationships. This isn't a development consultancyâ€”I'm not available for custom software projects or client work in this space.</p>
            
            <p>The Product Studio represents my personal investment in solving the loneliness epidemic through thoughtful technology. These projects are designed for potential friends and family investment as I develop them into sustainable businesses that prioritize human connection over growth metrics.</p>
            
            <p>If you're interested in the intersection of technology and human relationships, or want to stay updated on progress, feel free to try the products and share feedback.</p>
