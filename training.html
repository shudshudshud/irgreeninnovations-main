            <h1>Training & Workshops</h1>
            
            <p>I've been training teams and professionals across Southeast Asia since 2018. My experience spans universities (University of Santo Tomas, Sunway University, NUS), polytechnics (Ngee Ann Polytechnic, Republic Polytechnic, Singapore Polytechnic), government programs (National Youth Council Singapore), international initiatives (Go Digital ASEAN supported by Google.org and The Asia Foundation), and private sector engagements (civil engineering firms, social enterprises).</p>
            
            <p>I've trained 200+ participants for Singapore's National Youth Council, mentored 50+ graduate students at NUS, and delivered sessions across 5+ countries. Every workshop draws from real experience: the farmer who changed my understanding of user research, the partnership negotiation that saved a failing startup, the systems thinking that helped coordinate across 14 regions.</p>
            
            <p>You won't get generic frameworks here. You'll get the stuff I wish someone had taught me before I made expensive mistakes.</p>

                <h2>Building Sustainable Impact</h2>
                <p><em>Whether you're just starting to understand climate action or need to implement ESG strategies, these workshops provide the scientific foundation, business context, and practical tools to drive meaningful environmental change. Perfect for organizations that want to move beyond greenwashing to genuine impact.</em></p>
                
                <p><strong>Carbon Foundations: Understanding Climate Impact</strong><br>
                Most SMEs know they should care about carbon but don't know where to start. This isn't just about accounting‚Äîit's a complete primer covering the science (why this matters), the societal context (what's expected of businesses), and practical steps you can actually take. You'll leave with a clear roadmap, not just good intentions.<br>
                <em>Perfect for: Business leaders, sustainability coordinators, and teams new to environmental responsibility</em></p>
                
                <p><strong>Navigating ESG: From Compliance to Strategy</strong><br>
                ESG isn't going away, but most companies treat it as a reporting exercise rather than strategic advantage. I'll show you how to think about environmental, social, and governance factors as business drivers, not just compliance requirements. You'll learn to identify genuine opportunities and avoid the common pitfalls that waste time and money.<br>
                <em>Perfect for: Project managers, strategy teams, and anyone tackling multi-stakeholder environmental challenges</em></p>
                
                <p><strong>Green Jobs Primer: Career Pathways in Sustainability</strong><br>
                The green economy is creating millions of new jobs, but most people don't know how to access them or what skills are actually needed. I'll map out career pathways across renewable energy, sustainable agriculture, green finance, and climate tech, showing you where the opportunities are and how to position yourself for them.<br>
                <em>Perfect for: Career changers, recent graduates, and professionals looking to transition into sustainability roles</em></p>

                <h2>Innovation Methods That Work</h2>
                <p><em>Innovation isn't about having brilliant ideas‚Äîit's about systematically turning ideas into solutions that people actually use. These workshops teach you how to validate concepts quickly, build with limited resources, and create genuine value rather than just clever technology.</em></p>
                
                <p><strong>Understanding the Problem-Opportunity Gap</strong><br>
                Most innovation fails because people build solutions before understanding the real problem. Drawing from testing with 300+ farmers across Southeast Asia, I'll teach you how to identify the gap between macro challenges and micro intervention points. You'll learn to see problems as systems, then find the specific leverage points where small changes create big impact.<br>
                <em>Perfect for: Product managers, UX designers, and teams building solutions for complex social challenges</em></p>
                
                <p><strong>Building for Impact: Modern Tools for Social Innovation</strong><br>
                Taking AgriG8 from concept to market validation in 2 months taught me how to bridge the problem-solution gap fast. I'll share the exact process using modern tools‚Äîno-code platforms, LLM integration with Claude and other AI tools, and rapid testing methods that let you validate ideas quickly and cheaply before investing in full development.<br>
                <em>Perfect for: Early-stage entrepreneurs, innovation teams, and social ventures looking to build solutions efficiently</em></p>
                
                <p><strong>Impact Entrepreneurship: Building a Minimally Viable Organization</strong><br>
                Being employee #1 at a startup and co-founding a social enterprise taught me one thing: good intentions don't pay salaries. But you also don't need a massive organization to create change. I'll show you how to build a minimally viable organization that creates both financial sustainability and real impact, using the sustainable business model canvas and systems thinking to design for scalable change.<br>
                <em>Perfect for: Social entrepreneurs, impact investors, and leaders building purpose-driven organizations</em></p>

                <h2>Negotiation & Stakeholder Management</h2>
                <p><em>Most business failures come from people problems, not technical problems. These workshops teach you how to navigate complex stakeholder dynamics, resolve conflicts constructively, and build partnerships that actually last. Essential skills for anyone working on initiatives that require coordination across different groups.</em></p>
                
                <p><strong>B2B Negotiation: Creating Win-Win Outcomes</strong><br>
                Negotiation isn't about being aggressive‚Äîit's about being smart. I'll teach you the techniques I used to secure mid-6 figure funding and build partnerships that actually last. You'll learn how to prepare, when to push, and when to walk away.<br>
                <em>Perfect for: Business development teams, executives, and anyone who needs to negotiate high-stakes deals</em></p>
                
                <p><strong>Cross-Cultural Stakeholder Management</strong><br>
                Working across cultures isn't just about being polite. Coordinating projects across 5 Southeast Asian countries taught me how to build trust, navigate different communication styles, and get things done when everyone has different expectations.<br>
                <em>Perfect for: International teams, project managers, and leaders working in diverse cultural contexts</em></p>
                
                <p><strong>Partnership Negotiations: Building Strategic Alliances</strong><br>
                Most partnerships fail because people don't think through the details upfront. I'll show you how to structure deals that contributed to 50% revenue increases‚Äîcovering equity, roles, responsibilities, and what to do when things change.<br>
                <em>Perfect for: Strategic partnership teams, business development leaders, and entrepreneurs exploring collaborations</em></p>
                
                <p><strong>Crisis Communication & Conflict Resolution</strong><br>
                Leading cross-functional teams means dealing with conflict before it explodes. I'll teach you how to spot tensions early, address them directly, and turn disagreements into better decisions.<br>
                <em>Perfect for: Team leaders, project managers, and HR professionals managing complex stakeholder dynamics</em></p>
