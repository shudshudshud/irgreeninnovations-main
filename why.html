            <h1>Why I Do This Work</h1>
            
            <h2>The Problems We Face</h2>
            <p><strong>Climate change threatens everything we've built.</strong> Rising seas, extreme weather, and ecosystem collapse demand urgent action. But technical solutions alone won't save us—we need social systems that can coordinate complex responses across cultures, industries, and generations.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Social mobility is stagnating.</strong> Despite unprecedented wealth creation, opportunities remain concentrated among those who already have access. Young people face housing crises, education debt, and labor markets that reward credentials over capability. Innovation without inclusion creates prosperity that fewer people can reach.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Loneliness is becoming epidemic.</strong> Social isolation affects mental health, decision-making, and our ability to work together on shared challenges. When people feel disconnected, they're more susceptible to polarization, less likely to engage in collective action, and less resilient in the face of change.</p>
            
            <h2>Why These Problems Connect</h2>
            <p>These aren't separate issues—they're symptoms of systems that prioritize short-term extraction over long-term flourishing. Climate solutions require unprecedented cooperation. Social mobility depends on inclusive innovation. Addressing loneliness means rebuilding community structures that help us navigate uncertainty together.</p>
            
            <p>Technology can either accelerate these problems or help solve them. Most current platforms optimize for engagement over wellbeing, growth over sustainability, efficiency over equity. We need tools designed for different outcomes.</p>
            
            <h2>My Approach</h2>
            <p>I work on both <strong>capacity building</strong> and <strong>connection technology</strong> because lasting change requires both individual capability and collective coordination.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Through training</strong>, I help people develop the knowledge and skills needed to drive sustainable innovation—whether that's understanding carbon markets, facilitating difficult conversations, or building organizations that can adapt to changing conditions.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Through technology</strong>, I build tools that help people form deeper relationships and coordinate more effectively. Instead of optimizing for time-on-platform, I optimize for relationship quality and authentic human connection.</p>
            
            <p>Both approaches start with human behavior, not abstract theory. Change happens when people have the knowledge they need and the relationships that support them in using it.</p>
